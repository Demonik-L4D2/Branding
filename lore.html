            To the survivors, the veterans, and the newcomers: many of you
            joined this caravan at different waypoints. Some have been here

              In the fading days of 2019, a spark flickered in the dark.
              Ascension was born—not in a grand hall, but hosted on the humble
              machinery of its founder, a rig that hummed with the strain of our
              ambition. We were a small band of survivors then, unified by a
              singular vision of
              <span class="highlight">"Hardcore Co-op."</span> We didn't want
              safety; we wanted a world where the shadows grew taller and the
              monsters grew stronger for every soul that dared to join the
              fight. It was fast, it was brutal, and it was unapologetically
              ours.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              But even then, the foundation was cracked. The Founder held the
              keys to the kingdom but lacked the heart for its day-to-day
              governance. To keep the peace, the
              <span class="highlight">"Admin Rights"</span> were distributed
              like candy—a gift of power that, in hindsight, sowed the first
              noxious seeds of discord. Egos clashed in the vacuum of true
              leadership, and the first fractures began to show in our armor.

              As the seasons turned, the first great rift appeared. Differences
              in philosophy became impassable canyons, and the original council
              splintered. Many fled to start their own tribes, leaving Ascension
              to question its own soul. We tried to pivot, softening our jagged
              edges to welcome more travelers, but the
              <span class="highlight">"Original Sin"</span> remained: a world
              without a dedicated architect is a world that eventually falls to
              ruin. The server performance degraded, the trolls invaded our
              sanctuary, and the reliability of our home began to crumble under
              the weight of neglect.

              In 2022, a shadow fell over the record. Donuts, a central figure
              of the council, vanished into the mists for six months. This
              <span class="highlight">"shot over the bow"</span> was a stark
              wake-up call to the Founder—a realization that a community is not
              just comprised of code, plugins, and servers, but a living,
              breathing pulse of people that requires care.

              When he returned, the world had changed. The server was moved to a
              new host, and technical spirits were summoned to stabilize the
              land. But beneath the surface, a civil war of the mind was
              brewing. One side screamed for the return of the ancient "Old
              Ways" of hardcore brutality; the other sought a casual haven of
              mods and maps. Because the voices of the people were ignored, the
              cracks only widened, threatening to swallow us whole.

              By mid-2024, the golden age was but a fading memory. The halls of
              Ascension were quiet, its elders inactive or gone. In the vacuum
              of leadership, a new power rose beside the Founder, whispering
              poison. This led to the
              <span class="highlight">"Great Split"</span>—a final, bitter
              debate over the community’s future that would seal our fate.

          <div class="section-content">

              The choice was made: the Founder surrendered the keys to a single
              autocrat. Overnight, the "Purge" began. Lifelong allies were cast
              out without trial, and the custom maps and configurations we had
              called home were burned to the ground in a desperate attempt to
              force a return to the past. Seeing the writing on the wall,
              Donuts—the last of the original council—walked away from the
              ruins, vowing to build something better.

              We did not leave to start a war; we left to build a sanctuary.
              Demonik was forged on a sacred vow: that no single crown should
              rule. We are a collective, built on the bedrock belief that a
              community’s voice is its greatest strength, not a nuisance to be
              silenced.

              <span class="highlight">"Mass Exodus,"</span> our numbers swelled
              as refugees flooded our gates. While the road has been rocky and
              the nights long, we have built something far stronger than a mere
              server. We have built a brotherhood.
